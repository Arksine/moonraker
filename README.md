#  Moonraker - API Web Server for Klipper

Moonraker is a Python 3 based web server that exposes APIs with which
client applications may use to interact with Klipper. Communcation between
the Klippy host and Moonraker is done over a Unix Domain Socket.  Tornado
is used to provide Moonraker's server functionality.

Note that Moonraker does not come bundled with a client, you will need to
install one.  The following web clients are currently available:
- [Mainsail](https://github.com/meteyou/mainsail) by Meteyou
- [Fluidd](https://github.com/cadriel/fluidd) by Cadriel
